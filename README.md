# projectCode

This is the html, css and javascript code for our project. Go to the link provided in milestone 7 to access our application through Heroku.

The project goal is to create an application called TripSplit. It is a utility to track and manage group expenses (during a road trip, dinner, etc). The app tracks the expenses for each person and calculates how much each person owes or is owed in the click of a button.

Our repo is organized so that the most recent code is easy to find. We found it easier to submit .zip files via upload instead of committing constant changes, as we were often working on the same code at the same time. The "TripSplit" folder contains the html views and images without server integration. The actual organization of each zip is this: There is a folder for node, resources and views.  Then there are the .json files and server.js for postgreSQL integration.  The views folder has a pages folder inside of it, and inside of that there are the .ejs files for each page of the website.  The resources folder contains the css and image files that are used.  Our repository is organized like this to create separation between the elements and to make is easy to find a file based on the type (.ejs, .js, etc).
